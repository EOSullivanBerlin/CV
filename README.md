## Eoin O'Sullivan
Junior Full Stack Web Developer

After four successful years working in video production, I wanted a new challenge, and pursuing my interest in software has been the best career decision of my life. I love the mix of logic, creativity and learning that is required to write clean, reusable and tested code.
I attended Makers Academy in July 2017, one of the most discerning dev bootcamps in the world, where I was professionally trained in object orientated design, agile development, pair programming and test-driven development. Most importantly, these twelve intensive weeks have demonstrated that I can learn any new technologies quickly. 
My next step is to join an innovative team of brilliant developers and apply my new knowledge of web development while I learn all that I can as quickly as possible. 


## Skills

#### Communication

My years working as a script and storyboard artist for an explainer video company has honed my ability to compressing complex concepts into concise and entertaining videos and presentations. The lessons I learned about writing and storytelling are so important for clear communication.

#### People Person

I am an outgoing and friendly person who is very interested in other people. I quickly establish professional and jovial relationships with clients and co-workers. 

#### Quick Study 
I am able to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly. In my previous employment I was required to study and understand completely new business process, technical concepts in order to summarise the content into a script and every week. This propensity is further demonstrated in the speed that I have become proficient in the technologies required for Makers Academy.
