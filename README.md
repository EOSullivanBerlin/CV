After four successful years working in video production, I wanted a new challenge, and pursuing my interest in software has been the best decision of my life. I love the mix of logic, creativity and learning that is required to write clean reusable code.
I attended Makers Academy in July 2017, one of the most discerning dev bootcamps in the world, where I was professionally trained in object orientated design, agile development, pair programming and test-driven development. Most importantly, these twelve intensive weeks have demonstrated that I have natural ability for breaking down and solving problems and I am able to quickly learn new technologies. 
I can’t wait to join an innovative team of brilliant developers where I can apply my new knowledge of web development while I learn all that I can. 

## Skills

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL

#### Problem solving
My experience in Makers has convinced me that new syntax and frame works can be picked up quickly and easily. However, a good programer is distinguished from a bad one by their approach to problem solving. Test Driven Development is my compass when I have a programing problem to solve. I ardently follow the red, green and refactor cycle and when the days work is done I look upon my clean and well tested code with pride.

#### Quick Study 
A large part of my motivation for changing my career was to challenge myself and learn something new. The learning curve at Makers was steep (just the way I like it) and three programming languages, four web frame-works, numerous testing frame-works and a philosophy for code craftsmanship and team work later and I can report that I have barely whet my appetite. In my previous work creating explainer videos this inclination allowed me to study and understand completely new business processes and technical concepts and summarise their content into scripts every week.

#### Philosophy
Agile was a completely new concept to me starting Makers and its safe to say that I am a new convert. Its efficacy was made clear to me during numerous team projects where we created web applications very quickly and easily. There are many aspects to Agile that I could rave about but what I am most impressed with the way it simultaneously addresses issues at multiple levels of abstraction, from the individual, team, the clients role, communication and company. Its clear from the small taste I have had that adopting this philosophy at any of the levels will positively impact performance but together the benefits are far more than the sum of there parts. I want to work in a company that believes in and implements these methodologies.	

#### Communication
Years of working as a script and storyboard artist for an explainer video company has honed my ability to compressing complex concepts into concise and entertaining videos and presentations. The lessons I learned about writing and storytelling are so important for clear and engaging communication in any medium.

#### People Person
I am an outgoing and friendly person who is very interested in other people. I quickly establish professional and jovial relationships with clients and co-workers. Don't belive me? Why not get in touch and see for yourself.
