After four successful years working in video production, I wanted a new challenge, and pursuing my interest in software has been the best decision of my life. I graduated Makers Academy in September 2017, and am now looking forward to joining an innovative team of brilliant developers where I can apply my new knowledge of web development while I learn all that I can. 

## The Projects I am most proud of
For a complete list, see my [GitHub](https://github.com/EOSullivanBerlin?tab=repositories).

| Project   | Description | Technologies |
|---        |---         |---           |
| [Commandos](https://github.com/EOSullivanBerlin/commandos) | A bash tool for developers. Users can use the terminal as normal while receiving useful tips related to the commands they type. | Ruby, Shell, RSpec, Aruba |
|[Evil Notes](https://github.com/EOSullivanBerlin/notes-app)| A single page web app that allows a user to make notes. No libraries were used and we created our own testing framework. | Javascript|
|[Acebook](https://github.com/EOSullivanBerlin/acebook-remote-july-2017)| A group project to clone Facebook. It was a great experience of working with Agile methodologies. | Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL|

## Skills

#### Problem solving
I am confident that new syntax and frame works can be picked up quickly and easily. However, a good programmer is distinguished from a bad one by their approach to problem solving. Test-Driven Development is my compass when I have a programming problem to solve. I ardently follow the red, green and refactor cycle and when the day's work is done I look upon my clean and well tested code with pride.

#### Quick Study 
A large part of my motivation for changing my career was to challenge myself and learn something new. The learning curve at Makers was steep (just the way I like it) and three programming languages, four web frame-works, numerous testing frameworks and a philosophy for code craftsmanship and team work later, and I can report that I have barely whet my appetite.

#### Philosophy
Agile was a completely new concept to me starting Makers - I am a new convert. I want to work in a company that believes in and implements these methodologies.	

## Why did I become a programmer
I have always been interested in science and technology. At the age of sixteen I won second place for Biology in the BT Irish Young Scientist Award. I designed and conducted a population study of mosquitos in the marshes around my house (I was a strange child). I went on to study Microbiology in University where I had a great time tinkering with microbe genes. Perhaps it was the way undergraduates are taught but I felt that my creative side was being overlooked. 

To remedy this I pursued a career in film. Where I learned a great deal about how to communicate ideas through storytelling. However, over time I realised that I missed the challenge of solving novel problems. Luckily, this Goldilocks tale has a happy ending because I discovered coding which excites both hemispheres of my brain.
