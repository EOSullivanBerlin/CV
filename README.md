## Eoin O'Sullivan
Junior Full Stack Web Developer

After four successful years working in video production, I wanted a new challenge, and pursuing my interest in software has been the best career decision of my life. I love the mix of logic, creativity and learning that is required to write clean reusable code.
I attended Makers Academy in July 2017, one of the most discerning dev bootcamps in the world, where I was professionally trained in object orientated design, agile development, pair programming and test-driven development. Most importantly, these twelve intensive weeks have demonstrated that I have natural ability for  breaking down and solving problems and I quickly learn new technologies. 
I can’t wait to join an innovative team of brilliant developers where I can apply my new knowledge of web development while I learn all that I can as quickly as possible. 


## Skills

#### Quick Study 
A large part of my motivation for changing my career was to challenge myself and learn something new. The learning curve at Makers was steep (just the way I like it) and three programming languages, four web frame-works, numerous testing frame-works and a philosophy for code craftsmanship and team work later and I can report that I have barely whet my appetite. In my previous work creating explainer videos these skills were employed to study and understand completely new business processes and technical concepts in order to summarise their content into scripts every week.

#### Process
Agile programming was a completely new concept to me starting Makers but its safe to say that I am a new convert. Its efficacy was made clear to me during numerous team projects where we created minimum viable product very quickly and easily. I love how the customer is at the centre of everything from the user stories to the regular demos and feedback loops. This focuse ensures the greatest possible value is created for the customer's investment.  I work well in as part of an Agile team and I want to work in a company that believes in these methodologies.

#### Problem solving
My experience so far has convinced me that new syntax and frame works can be picked up quickly and easily. However, what really distinguishes a good programer from a bad is their approach to problem solving. Test Driven Development is my compass when I have a problem to solve. I ardently follow the red, green and refactor cycle and when the days work is done I look upon my clean and well tested code with pride.	

#### Communication
My years working as a script and storyboard artist for an explainer video company has honed my ability to compressing complex concepts into concise and entertaining videos and presentations. The lessons I learned about writing and storytelling are so important for clear and engaging communication in any medium.

#### People Person
I am an outgoing and friendly person who is very interested in other people. I quickly establish professional and jovial relationships with clients and co-workers.
